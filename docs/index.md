# Welcome to Neurograph

Neurograph is a graph deep learning library. This library is still in the early phases of development and will evolve over time. This can be thought of as a toy project for combining concepts from graph theory and deep learning.

## Purpose

* Experiment and research algorithms in graph theory and understand it's applications
* Tie concepts from graph theory to deep learning
* Data manipulation tool that utilize graph representations
* Invent a new graph neural network architecture
* Framework to visualize graphs
